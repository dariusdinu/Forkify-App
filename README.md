# Forkify App

This is a recipe application with custom recipe uploads. It let's the user search for different ingredients and a list of different recipes will be displayed. You can make manual changes such as the number of servings and the ingredient list will be updated. Also there are some additional features such as adding a bookmark to a recipe or even add a personal one. This is a complete project which helped me aquire a lot of knowledge and experience in terms of:

- Working with APIs
- The MVC Architecture
- Configuration Files
- Event Handlers
- Project Planning
- Modules
- Working with NPM
- Web Design rules
- Working with Babel
- Pagination

This project is part of a JavaScript course taken on Udemy (The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann)
